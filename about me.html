Everyone who do not know about me, their first impression on me is moody person. I do not smile alot at the public or at strangers but once people know about me, I really easy to laugh at something even a small thing. Like my dad, I think I am introvert and love to listen to other people's story or problem. I also do not trust people so easy, so yeah they to gain my trust first. Am I sociable? Definitily,no. I need a time to comfortable with someone. So yeah, there is only things that I can explain about myself.
